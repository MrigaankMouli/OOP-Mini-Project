Cattle Insurance provides protection for livestock against various risks that can lead to cattle losses. Coverage typically includes incidents such as illness, injury, death, and theft, providing a safety net for cattle owners against unforeseen events. This type of insurance is vital for managing the risks associated with cattle farming, particularly for events that impact animal health and well-being.
