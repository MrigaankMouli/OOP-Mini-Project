Yield Protection (YP) is an insurance program primarily for crop producers but can also be relevant for livestock producers in cases where feed yield impacts cattle production costs. YP offers coverage based on the projected yield of crops (like corn and soybeans) that serve as livestock feed, compensating farmers if their actual yields fall below a specified guarantee due to natural causes, such as drought, pests, or disease.
