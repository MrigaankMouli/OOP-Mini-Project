LRP is a federally subsidized insurance program designed to protect livestock producers against declines in market prices for cattle, swine, and lamb. This insurance allows producers to choose a price level that acts as a safety net, ensuring they receive a minimum price per head for their livestock if market prices fall below the chosen level. LRP provides coverage for a specific time period, helping mitigate financial losses caused by price volatility in the livestock market.
