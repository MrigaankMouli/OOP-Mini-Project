LGM is an insurance program aimed at protecting the profit margins of livestock producers by covering the difference between the feed costs and market prices. This type of insurance helps producers manage risks associated with fluctuations in feed costs and livestock prices, particularly for cattle and dairy operations. LGM policies cover the margin between expected income from livestock sales and feed costs, rather than just price declines.
